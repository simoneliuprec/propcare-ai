      "\n",
      "Transformers are a type of model used in machine learning, especially for understanding and generating language (like creating sentences, answering questions, or translating languages).\n",
      "\n",
      "**How they work in simple terms:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input words as numbers:** When you give a sentence to a transformer, it first turns the words into numbers that the model can understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Paying attention:** The most important part is the **attention mechanism**. This lets the model look at all the words in a sentence at the same time and figure out which words are important for understanding the meaning of each word.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Layers of understanding:** The transformer has multiple layers, each refining the understanding of the sentence. It keeps passing information through these layers, getting better at capturing the relationships between words.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Output:** Finally, it produces something useful based on the input, like translating the sentence or predicting the next word.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why transformers are powerful:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Unlike older models, transformers can look at every word in a sentence together, not just one at a time.\n",
      "- This lets them understand context better and handle longer sentences effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a nutshell, transformers are smart readers that look at a whole sentence all at once to understand and generate language!\n"

    "1. SAFETY FIRST: If the user mentions gas smell, fire, sparking electricity, or massive flooding, IMMEDIATE STOP. Tell them to call emergency services. Do not troubleshoot.\n",

    "4. NO DANGEROUS ADVICE: Never suggest touching live wires, gas pipes, or climbing on roofs. Only suggest \"safe\" user-serviceable fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "TROUBLESHOOTING FLOW:\n",
    "1. Ask for a clear description of the problem (and ask for a photo if helpful).\n",
    "2. Based on the problem, look up \"Safe Standard Operating Procedures\" in your training.\n",
    "3. Suggest the most likely simple fix.\n",
